The most up to date code is found in the [stand alone version](https://github.com/antoinepado/glitch_runner_standalone), for the time being this notebook will be kept as is but it is for educational purposes only and the validity of the simulation is not correct (wrong mosaicity and lattice spacing variability values ...).
